# Frontend

The frontend group provides the two frontends  for CEDAR (main CEDAR and OpenView). 

## Start frontend

```sh
startfrontend
```

## Check frontend

```sh
cedarss
```

You should see all the services in the `Front End` (4th) block in `Running` status.

If this is not the case, please stop the frontend using one of these ways:

* with the `stopfrontend` command from another console
* with a single ++ctrl++ + C form the active console.

Then please try running them again. If this does not help, please analyze the output for indications of what went wrong.

## Stop frontend

```sh
stopfrontend
```
