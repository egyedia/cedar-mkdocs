# Introduction

The CEDAR Docker distribution is available for evaluation purposes.

It is a low cost option (both from the necessary hardware and time perspective) to try out CEDAR.
It can be up and running in 20 minutes on a regular machine if you follow this guide.

If you like CEDAR, and you wish to install it in the permanent way, you can do that by customizing the Docker install (changing the default configuration options)
or by installing it natively.
