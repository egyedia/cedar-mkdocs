# Introduction

**IMPORTANT: The CEDAR Docker distribution is currently not being maintained so we won't be able to provide any help or support if you run into issues. We recommend to follow the [CEDAR Developer Install Guide](https://metadatacenter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install-developer/intro.html).**

The CEDAR Docker distribution is available for evaluation purposes. It is a low cost option (both from the necessary hardware and time perspective) to try out CEDAR.
It can be up and running in 20 to 40 minutes (depending on your internet connection speed) on a well-equipped machine for software development if you follow this guide.

If you like CEDAR, and you wish to install it as a production system, you can do that by customizing the Docker install (changing the default configuration options)
or by installing it natively.
