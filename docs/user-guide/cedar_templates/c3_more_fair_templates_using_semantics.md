# Intro: More FAIR Templates Using Semantics

The principles of FAIR metadata—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability—
are useful to understand metadata good practices. 
We made semantics a key technology in the CEDAR system, because semantics support
all of the principles that make up FAIR metadata.

In this chapter we describe how the semantics in CEDAR make its templating resources
more FAIR, and thereby make CEDAR metadata more FAIR.
By understanding how CEDAR's semantics contribute to FAIR metadata, 
you will learn how to make metadata based on your templates 
more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.
