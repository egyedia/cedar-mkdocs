# Intro: Description of a Template

## **CEDAR's Metadata Template**

In CEDAR, forms are created as what we call Metadata Templates, or just 'templates'. 
The templates contain individual questions—what we call Metadata Fields, or 'fields'—and 
collections of those fields called Metadata Elements ('elements'). 

In this chapter we provide a basic information about CEDAR Metadata Templates, including
what they contain and how they are organized.
