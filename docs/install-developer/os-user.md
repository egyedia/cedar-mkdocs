# CEDAR User

???+ warning "Important"
    
    The current guide assumes that you created a dedicated user `cedar-dev` to follow these steps.

    It is totally fine if you proceed with your regular user. However, please replace your current username wherever you see `cedar-dev` throughout this guide. 
    The primary place where you will need to make this change is the configuration files for `nginx`.
