# Maven

You will need `Maven` to build CEDAR.

## Install Maven

```sh
brew install maven
```

## Verify Maven

After the installation, please verify the version in a shell: 
```sh
mvn --version
```

You should see something like:
```
Apache Maven 3.6.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.6.3_1/libexec
Java version: 14.0.1, vendor: N/A, runtime: /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/14.0.1/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.15.6", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

It is fine if `maven` uses `openjdk` as seen above.
