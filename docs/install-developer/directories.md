# CEDAR User

**Important**

The current guide assumes that you created a dedicated user `cedar-dev` to follow these steps.

It is totally fine if you proceed with your regular user. However, please replace your current username wherever you see `cedar-dev` throughout this guide. 

# CEDAR Home

You will need a directory where all the CEDAR-related code, configuration, log files and some executable will reside.
You should create a directory under your home directory:

    mkdir ~/CEDAR 

**Important**

Of course, you can choose to have this CEDAR home directory in a different place. We have an environment variable which holds this path.
We suggest, however, that your CEDAR home directory path does not contain spaces or special characters.

If you see this path referenced directly in this guide (as in `~/CEDAR`) and you did not use the same path, please replace it with the proper value on your system.
