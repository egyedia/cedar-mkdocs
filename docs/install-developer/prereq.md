# Homebrew

You will need `brew` to install some of the components.

If you do not have it yet, please install it following their guide at [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

Or you can do this:

    /bin/bash -c \
    "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# OpenSSL

You most probably already have `openssl` on your system. If not, please install it using:

    brew install openssl
