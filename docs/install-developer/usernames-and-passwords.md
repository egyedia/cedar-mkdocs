# Usernames and Passwords

Throughout this guide we use some default usernames and passwords.

The usernames reflect the system name they are associated with and their usage intent.
The passwords are usually `changeme`.

You are welcome to change the usernames and/or passwords, but please make note of them.
You will need them to properly configure the environment variables that govern the CEDAR configuration.
